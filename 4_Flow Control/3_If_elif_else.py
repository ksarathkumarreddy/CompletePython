In python everything is an object only.
for example:
========
let's take 
a = 44
how python interpreter can assume is we have in built  modules are there in that module we have int module
like __int__
first it will call int type object
and then..,,,
it will take a rapper and store the value and give refference to variable A..
'''

a = 10
b = 20
if(a < b):
    print("a is lessthan b")
else:
    print("b is less than a")
